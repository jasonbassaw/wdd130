        The home page will be the page holding the other pages. It will be like the primary point that will serve as a hub linking to the various site or pages of my portfolio online site. it will come with a portfolio logo and a hero banner that will quickly get the attention of visitors. These features of visuals are to give visitors an immersive experience to stay in mi site to get to know me more.

      <h2>Dynamic Elements and JavaScript Functionality</h2>
<p>
  My portfolio website will incorporate multiple dynamic features powered by JavaScript to enhance interactivity and user experience. These features demonstrate my understanding and use of modern JavaScript techniques, including JS Objects, ES Modules, Arrays, and array methods.
</p>

<h3>Quote Slideshow</h3>
<p>
  A rotating quote slideshow on the homepage uses a JavaScript array containing motivational quotes. The <code>setInterval()</code> method updates the quote every 5 seconds. This feature utilizes DOM manipulation and demonstrates working with arrays and dynamic content updates.
</p>

<h3>About Me Slideshow</h3>
<p>
  On the About Me page, I implemented an image slideshow that cycles through pictures of me. This is built using a collection of image elements accessed with <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> and uses JavaScript logic to rotate visibility using array-like structures and looping.
</p>

<h3>JS Objects</h3>
<p>
  To dynamically generate content, I will use JavaScript objects to store data such as my personal profile and skills. This allows for flexible rendering of content using object properties. For example, a <code>userProfile</code> object can be used to insert my name, degree, and school into the DOM dynamically.
