            <h2>Enos 1:8</h2>
            <p>And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass
            away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>

            <h2>Alma 17:2-3</h2>
            <p> Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice
            exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they
            had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the
            scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.
            But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy,
            and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</p>
